# article_sentiment_analysis
We are using Tkinter to create the GUI and nltk for nlp to analyse the article text.
Textblob and newspaper are used for the sentiment analysis.
The user can input a URL of an article and upon clicking summarize, the application will provide a summary along with the author names, publication date and the sentiment.
